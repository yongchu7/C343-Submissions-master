/* Analysis:
 
 In this sort the running time T(n) = c1m + c2n, so the effective depends on the value m and n.
 
 For m > n, the counting sort will sort m times and the жи(n) = m
 
 for m < n, the counting sort will sort n times and the жи(n) = n, and in this case, 
 
 running time : T(n) = c1m + c2n
