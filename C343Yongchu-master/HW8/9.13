a,it is not a good hash function.
because if n is 2 slot, when the k is 10,k/n = 5, we can not put the k to the hashtable.---bad hash function

b.whatever k is ,its return would be one. Which means that we put the number to hashtable without any judgement, if it is on 
the open hashtable, it would put it on an array  on the first slots. if it is on the close hashtable, the number would be added up
line by line. In this case, if we put the unsorted number into hashtable, it is still hard to serach ,only for number by number.
----so that it is a bad hash table function

c.it is not a good hash function
because random(n) is a uncertain, assume that the n is 5, so that when you insert the number to the hashtable, maybe random(5) is 
4, when you search (have the same k),random(5) may be 3, so that we will get the different number when insert and search.
--bad hash function

d.it is a good mod, it is a normal way to build up a hashtable.
