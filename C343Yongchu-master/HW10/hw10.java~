 * In the worst case, and algorithm for finding the shortest path between a given
 * pair of vertices i and j will have to visit every node in the graph. In the
 * process of visiting every node in the graph, we can determine the shortest
 * paths from the start vertex to all the nodes. Thus, in the worst case, the
 * cost for finding all of the shortest paths is no worse than the cost to find the
 * shortest path between a specified pair of vertices.
